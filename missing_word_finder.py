# 1. Training Corpus

# Overlay the syllable count corpus (cmudict) with the training corpus (train.txt). Wwords that appear in the training -->
# corpus but NOT the syllable count corpus get added to the MISSING WORDS DICTIONARY, which iswritten to missing_words.json

# Write a program that takes the training corpus(train.txt) and compares it against cmudict (syllable count corpus) then ->
# finds the words in the training corpus that are not in cmudict and allows the user to manually enter the number ->
# of syllables for those words, which is then saved to the missing_words.json file
