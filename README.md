# HaikuGenerator
This is Haiku Generator project that leverages 1st-level and 2nd-level Markov Chaining (implented with hashmap) to create interesting poems. 
It is deployed on Render, with the front-end being built on Svelte while the back-end is built on Flask. 
The idea for this project is based on Lee Vaughan's Impractical Python Projects.
